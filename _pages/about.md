Hi! I'm a PhD student at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) in Bilbao, Spain. I am working in the field of PDEs, specifically in the analysis of inverse problems related to Schr√∂dinger equations.

In particular, I have been focused in the identifiability of singular electric potentials by measuring the scattering of harmonic waves. 

At the moment, I'm working on a similar problem, in this case related to measurements over initial and final states of quantum systems.

For now, my research has been confined to the realm of theorem proving, but I have enjoyed running simulations in the past, and I wouldn't mind doing some computational work in the future.

Outside mathematics, I'm an outdoor enthusiast, failed surfer and aspiring climber.
